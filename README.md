# Personal Website  

My personal website is built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. It is based on the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). The site serves as a platform to showcase my work, research, and projects.

## Usage

For detailed instructions on how to configure, customize, add/migrate content, and more read the [theme's documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).

## Development

Make sure you have Ruby and Bundler installed on your machine before setting up the project. To set up your environment to develop this website, run `bundle install`. To test the website locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve -l -H localhost` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000/`. This starts a Jekyll server with live reloading only accessible from your local machine.
