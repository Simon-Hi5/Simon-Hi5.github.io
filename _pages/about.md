I'm Simon, a software engineering student with a genuine interest in research and emerging technologies. I enjoy tackling new challenges and learning from each experience. With a solid foundation in software engineering and practical skills in artificial intelligence, data analysis, and software testing, I focus on bridging academic insights with real-world applications. When I'm not working or studying, you'll find me training for triathlons.
