Hello! I'm Simon, a PhD candidate with a background in software engineering, exploring the intersection of automotive testing and artificial intelligence. My research focuses on anomaly detection in time series, and I am passionate about applying machine learning and data science to solve complex problems. Outside of research, I enjoy pushing my limits through triathlon training.
