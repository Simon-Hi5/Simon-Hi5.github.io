I'm a software engineer and researcher passionate about AI-driven testing and data analysis in the automotive industry. With a strong foundation in software engineering and hands-on experience in machine learning, embedded systems, and large-scale software testing, I thrive at the intersection of research and industry. I enjoy solving complex problems, building intelligent systems, and continuously pushing the boundaries of innovation. When I'm not working or learning, you'll find me training for triathlons.
